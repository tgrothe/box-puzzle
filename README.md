## box-puzzle

A large cube-shaped box has the dimensions `5x5x5`. This box is to be completely filled with smaller boxes.

Possible candidates are:

    1x1x1, 5-fold
    1x2x4, 6-fold
    2x2x3, 6-fold

An additional "magic" box with the dimensions `1x1x1` should always be placed in the middle/center of the large box.

This should be solved with backtracking in Java.
